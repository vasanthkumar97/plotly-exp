"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence.

Method: HHS=Household survey, SS=School survey, A=Adjusted from other sources, I=Indirect estimates, R=Registry. 

UNODC Adjustments: a=adjusted for age (15-64), b=population-based/household-type study/survey, c=adjusted from a limited geographic population-based study/survey, d=adjusted from school/youth survey, e=adjusted from lifetime/monthly prevalence adjusted to annual prevalence, f=adjusted from specialized population surveys (including Rapid Assessments), g=adjusted from treatment data, h=adjusted from drug registries, i=adjusted from HIV, problematic drug users (only for heroin), j=lifetime prevalence reported, x=figure may include non-medical use of prescription opioids, z=figures may also include other non-ATS stimulants, z*= figures include the use of prescription stimulants, (non-prescription/non-therapeutic use). 

The 'Method' and 'Adjustment/notes' columns have been completed only for more recent data included in previous and present issues of the World Drug Report. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence.

UNODC Adjustments: a=adjusted for age (15-64), b=population-based/household-type study/survey, c=adjusted from a limited geographic population-based study/survey, d=adjusted from school/youth survey, e=adjusted from lifetime/monthly prevalence adjusted to annual prevalence, f=adjusted from specialized population surveys (including Rapid Assessments), g=adjusted from treatment data, h=adjusted from drug registries, i=adjusted from HIV, problematic drug users (only for heroin), j=lifetime prevalence reported, x=figure may include non-medical use of prescription opioids, z=figures may also include other non-ATS stimulants, z*= figures include the use of prescription stimulants, (non-prescription/non-therapeutic use).

"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence.

Where a country has reported a combined prevalence for amphetamines and other stimulants these have been reported under ""Amphetamines"" and a flag included to state if this includes prescription stimulants. Where a combined prevalence has not been reported by the Member State and the prescription stimulant prevalence is known, this has been reported under ""Prescription stimulants"". 

Method: HHS=Household survey, SS=School survey, A=Adjusted from other sources, I=Indirect estimates, R=Registry. 

UNODC Adjustments: a=adjusted for age (15-64), b=population-based/household-type study/survey, c=adjusted from a limited geographic population-based study/survey, d=adjusted from school/youth survey, e=adjusted from lifetime/monthly prevalence adjusted to annual prevalence, f=adjusted from specialized population surveys (including Rapid Assessments), g=adjusted from treatment data, h=adjusted from drug registries, i=adjusted from HIV, problematic drug users (only for heroin), j=lifetime prevalence reported, x=figure may include non-medical use of prescription opioids, z=figures may also include other non-ATS stimulants, z*= figures include the use of prescription stimulants, (non-prescription/non-therapeutic use),  z**= figures only include prescription stimulants.

"Except where the prevalence values are taken from household surveys, changes between years need to be interpreted with caution as they might reflect a change in the methodology or the data source from which the estimate was derived and therefore should not be considered as a change in prevalence.
Opioids include prescription opioids, opiates (opiates include opium and heroin). Includes estimates for the countries for which a total Opioid prevalence was reported or available.

Method: HHS=Household survey, SS=School survey, A=Adjusted from other sources, I=Indirect estimates, R=Registry. 

Note: According to the Government of Canada, while prescription opioid use in Canada is reportable (see Table on Prescription opioids), other opioid use was not reportable in 2011, 2012 and 2013; data on heroin and opium use based on the household survey is not reportable and the Government of Canada does not report an estimate based on indirect methods.

UNODC Adjustments: a=adjusted for age (15-64), b=population-based/household-type study/survey, c=adjusted from a limited geographic population-based study/survey, d=adjusted from school/youth survey, e=adjusted from lifetime/monthly prevalence adjusted to annual prevalence, f=adjusted from specialized population surveys (including Rapid Assessments), g=adjusted from treatment data, h=adjusted from drug registries, i=adjusted from HIV, problematic drug users (only for heroin), j=lifetime prevalence reported, x=figure may include non-medical use of prescription opioids, z=figures may also include other non-ATS stimulants, z*= figures include the use of prescription stimulants (non-prescription/non-therapeutic use).
